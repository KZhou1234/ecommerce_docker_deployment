## Instances
* Jenkins: t3.micro
* Jenkins Node: t3.medium
-  Not like previous projects, the pipeline and actual build, test, deploy stages will take place in Jenkins server, Jenkins Node will handle the heavier workload in this project, including the build, test, deploy and so on, so it requires more resources.
